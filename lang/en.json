    "About.Description": "Graduated with full marks in Computer Science from the University of Milan. I worked for years, during my school and academic studies, as a freelancer on behalf of companies and private individuals. At the same time I had the opportunity to experiment with new technologies in my free time, ranging across various areas of the sector from web apps to embedded systems. I currently hold the position of technical lead at Zerouno SRL, where I keep myself constantly updated day by day, leading a team of developers in their professional growth and taking care of implementing architectural solutions that increase company productivity and efficiency. Sideways as a hobby, I am fascinated by following the financial markets, in particular the technological sector, increasingly trying to understand what the factors that move them are and how to analyze them. Since I was a child I have always been curious, competitive and hungry both in the sporting and personal fields, I have never been satisfied with the goals achieved and it is probably also due to these characteristics that, just mentioning the professional field, I have achieved relevant corporate positions at 23 years old and completed dozens of projects.",

As the tender was an officially binding document with a set publication date and time, we had to adopt a strategic approach in managing tasks. To optimize time, we decided to postpone all backoffice operations that were not immediately necessary for the tender's publication. This allowed us to focus on the absolute priority: the development of the frontoffice part accessible by municipalities, entities, and companies. This decision ensured that we could meet the stringent deadline without compromising the quality and functionality of the system, demonstrating our ability to adapt effectively to client needs and time constraints.",
