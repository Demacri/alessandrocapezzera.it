    "About.Description": "Graduated with full marks in Computer Science from the University of Milan. I worked for years, during my school and academic studies, as a freelancer on behalf of companies and private individuals. At the same time I had the opportunity to experiment with new technologies in my free time, ranging across various areas of the sector from web apps to embedded systems. I currently hold the position of technical lead at Zerouno SRL, where I keep myself constantly updated day by day, leading a team of developers in their professional growth and taking care of implementing architectural solutions that increase company productivity and efficiency. Sideways as a hobby, I am fascinated by following the financial markets, in particular the technological sector, increasingly trying to understand what the factors that move them are and how to analyze them. Since I was a child I have always been curious, competitive and hungry both in the sporting and personal fields, I have never been satisfied with the goals achieved and it is probably also due to these characteristics that, just mentioning the professional field, I have achieved relevant corporate positions at 23 years old and completed dozens of projects.",

To demonstrate functionality, a program is loaded that inserts 6 elements into the main memory, each 4 bytes in the form of an array.
